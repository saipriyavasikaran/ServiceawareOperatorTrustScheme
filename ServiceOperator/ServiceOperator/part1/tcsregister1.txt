According to Definitions 1 and 2, SOTS belongs to the
TTP-based approach [6], with the broker acting as the TTP.
According to Definition 3, SOTS is also an expanded trust
evaluation approach [12], beyond traditional trust schemes
that always focus on one-sided trust factors of service
resources. The expanded trust model incorporates security,
reliability, and availability factors into a trust vector. Thus,
the new trust scheme will contain data that can be imported
from existing models (that is, security, reliability, availability)
to form a comprehensive trust model for a multiple
cloud environment.
3.2 Trust-Aware Brokering System Architecture
Fig. 2 shows a schematic of our architecture. Conceptually,
the proposed middleware architecture consists of a number
of core modules, including the trusted resource matchmaking
and distributing module, the adaptive trust evaluation
module, the agent-based service operator acquisition module,
and the resource management module, among others.
Adaptive trust evaluation module. This module is the core
of the trust-aware cloud computing system, and is the major
focus of this paper. Using this module, the broker can
dynamically sort high-performance resources by analyzing
the historic resource information in terms of providing
highly trusted resources.
