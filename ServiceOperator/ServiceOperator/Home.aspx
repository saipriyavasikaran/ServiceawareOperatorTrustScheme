    <p id="p">This paper proposes a service operator-aware trust scheme (SOTS) for resource matchmaking across multiple clouds.
Through analyzing the built-in relationship between the users, the broker, and the service resources, this paper proposes a middleware
framework of trust management that can effectively reduces user burden and improve system dependability. Based on multidimensional
resource service operators, we model the problem of trust evaluation as a process of multi-attribute decision-making, and
develop an adaptive trust evaluation approach based on information entropy theory.</p><p id="p"> This adaptive approach can overcome the limitations
of traditional trust schemes, whereby the trusted operators are weighted manually or subjectively. As a result, using SOTS, the
broker can efficiently and accurately prepare the most trusted resources in advance, and thus provide more dependable resources to
users. Our experiments yield interesting and meaningful observations that can facilitate the effective utilization of SOTS in a large-scale
multi-cloud environment.</p>
