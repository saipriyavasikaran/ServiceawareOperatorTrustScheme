Resource register module. It manages and indexes all the
resources available from multiple cloud providers, and
obtains information from each particular cloud resource,
acting as pricing interface for users, and updating the database
when new information is available.
3.3 Statistics-Based Service Operator Measurement
When matchmaking a resource for users, the cloud broker
must first consider whether the resource has the required
capabilities (for example, CPU frequency, memory size, and
hard disk capacity), and second, whether it is likely to complete
the task successfully [19]. The first of these considerations
can be evaluated by the resource�s availability, which
can determine whether a resource has the required capability
or not. The second consideration mainly focuses on the
reliability and security of the resource, which can be evaluated
by the resource�s service operators. Reliability refers to
the probability of service for a given duration, and we use
six operators to reflect this factor. The most basic needs of
security pertain to the absence of unauthorized access to a
system. We use the security levels of a service site to
