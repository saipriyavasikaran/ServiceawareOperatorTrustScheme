It traces its origin back to Christian Frederick Schwartz
, the first German missionary, supported by the Society f
or the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (S.P.C.K) in South
 India. He built a small school near the Rock Fort in 
Tiruchirappalli in 1762. It was renamed after Reginald Heber, 
the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, who came to Tiruchirappalli in 1826
 and died on his way to Travancore. The Heber Memorial School
 became a full-fledged high school in 1864. In 1873 the School
 was raised to a Second Grade College and in 1882 it became a 
First Grade College. It was then known as S.P.G College. It was 
the first college to be established in Tiruchirappalli. It was 
merged with Madras Christian College (MCC), Tambaram, in 1934
 as recommended by the Lindsay Commission on 
Christian Higher Education in India. It was revived like a

 phoenix on 24 June 1966.
